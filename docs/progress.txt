- What was implemented: Added meal CRUD server functions with validation and household scoping.
- Files changed: `src/server/meals.ts`, `src/server/household.ts`, `docs/prds/MEALS_PRD.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Meal server functions follow the Tasks pattern with input validators and response mapping.
  - Gotchas encountered: Export the household helper instead of re-creating it in feature server modules.
  - Useful context: Meal responses use ISO date strings for frontend consumption.
