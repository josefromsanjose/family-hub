## Codebase Patterns
- Use `getCurrentUserHouseholdId` from `src/server/household.ts` for household-scoped server logic.

- What was implemented: Added meal CRUD server functions with validation and household scoping.
- Files changed: `src/server/meals.ts`, `src/server/household.ts`, `docs/prds/MEALS_PRD.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Meal server functions follow the Tasks pattern with input validators and response mapping.
  - Gotchas encountered: Export the household helper instead of re-creating it in feature server modules.
  - Useful context: Meal responses use ISO date strings for frontend consumption.

- What was implemented: Marked household helper reuse story complete; confirmed helper is defined in `src/server/household.ts` and used by meal server functions.
- Files changed: `docs/prds/MEALS_PRD.md`, `docs/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: `getCurrentUserHouseholdId` is the shared helper for household scoping across server modules.
  - Gotchas encountered: Ensure PRD stories include a `passes:` line when marking completion.
  - Useful context: Household membership lookup uses `clerkUserId` in `householdMember`.

- What was implemented: Replaced local meal state with TanStack Query fetches/mutations, added loading/error UI, and wired add/delete to server functions.
- Files changed: `src/routes/_authed/meals/index.tsx`, `src/routes/_authed/meals/-meals.test.tsx`, `docs/prds/MEALS_PRD.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: For TanStack Query mutations, `createServerFn` receives an extra metadata argument in tests.
  - Gotchas encountered: Meal form labels need `htmlFor`/`id` pairing for RTL queries.
  - Useful context: Browser verification redirected to sign-in at `/sign-in?redirect=%2Fmeals`, so UI verification was blocked without credentials.

- What was implemented: Switched meal day handling to use week-based Date objects, store local start-of-day ISO strings, and match meals by date keys; updated tests to use current-week dates.
- Files changed: `src/routes/_authed/meals/index.tsx`, `src/routes/_authed/meals/-meals.test.tsx`, `docs/prds/MEALS_PRD.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Meal week rows derive from `startOfWeek(..., { weekStartsOn: 1 })` + `addDays` with local `startOfDay`.
  - Gotchas encountered: Meal rendering now depends on current-week dates, so tests should generate dates from `startOfWeek(new Date())` to stay deterministic.
  - Useful context: Browser verification still redirects to sign-in without credentials, blocking UI validation.

- What was implemented: Verified the Meal Planning UI in the browser, confirmed weekday dropdown shows Monday-Sunday and add form fields render alongside the weekly grid.
- Files changed: `docs/prds/MEALS_PRD.md`, `docs/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Meal Planning UI renders add form inline below the header and uses accessible labels for Day/Meal Type/Meal Name.
  - Gotchas encountered: None.
  - Useful context: Browser verification passed at `/meals` with the current session.
